### Hello World, I am Monique 👋😊

**MoniqueOberholzer/MoniqueOberholzer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi there, I am a self taught data scientist currently in university for my Bsc Data Science degree. I have been teaching myself Python, R, Tableau and MySQL.
Ohhhh and I am also a copywriter for B2B SaaS companies while I work on transitioning into Data Sciences full time 🌟
